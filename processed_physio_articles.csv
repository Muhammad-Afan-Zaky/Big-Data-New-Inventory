Lower Extremity Abnormalities in Children,"Leg and foot problems in childhood are common causes of parental concern. Rotational problems include intoeing and out-toeing. Intoeing is most common in infants and young children. Intoeing is caused by metatarsus adductus, internal tibial torsion, and femoral anteversion. Out-toeing is less common than intoeing and occurs more often in older children. Out-toeing is caused by external tibial torsion and femoral retroversion. Angular problems include genu varum (bowleg) and genu valgum (knock knee). With pes planus (flatfoot), the arch of the foot is usually flexible rather than rigid. A history and physical examination that include torsional profile tests and angular measurements are usually sufficient to evaluate patients with lower extremity abnormalities. Most children who present with lower extremity problems have normal rotational and angular findings (i.e., within two standard deviations of the mean). Lower extremity abnormalities that are within normal measurements resolve spontaneously as the child grows. Radiologic studies are not routinely required, except to exclude pathologic conditions. Orthotics are not beneficial. Orthopedic referral is often not necessary. Rarely, surgery is required in patients older than eight years who have severe deformities that cause dysfunction.","Caitlyn M Rerucha

Patellar Instability,"Patellar instability, by definition, is a condition where the patella bone pathologically disarticulates out from the patellofemoral joint, either subluxation or complete dislocation. This most often involves multiple factors, from acute trauma, chronic ligamentous laxity, bony malalignment, connective tissue disorder, or anatomical pathology. Over time, patients with patellar instability can have debilitating pain, limitations in basic function, and long-term arthritis.
    

Epidemiology


      
      Patella dislocations account for 3% of all knee injuries. The majority of injuries and pathology occurs in young individuals. In particular, most patients with patellar instability are aged 10 to 16 years old and female. The incidence of patellar instability in the general population is 5.8 per 100,000 and 29 per 100,000 in the 10 to 17-year-old age group. Many cases of first-time dislocations without loose bodies or articular damage are treated conservatively. However, the recurrence rate after conservative treatment can be up to 15 to 44%. Patients with a history of two or more dislocations have a 50% chance of recurrent dislocation episodes. A previous patellar dislocation is associated with the highest risk of persistent patellar instability later in life. Furthermore, in patients with a known medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) injury confirmed on MRI, the recurrence rates are even higher. With these recurrence rates, first-time dislocators can continue to have pain, functional limitations, and instability. 
    

      
      Patellar instability can be summarized, and each entity will be discussed further below:
    

Young patients (10 to 17 years old)Acute traumatic episodeChronic patholaxity - Ehlers-Danlos syndromeBony malalignment - femoral anteversion, genu valgum, and external tibial torsion / pronated feet. The three bony malalignments combined are termed ""Miserable Malalignment Syndrome"" and lead to an increased Q angle.Anatomical pathology - trochlear dysplasiaEventual progression to pain, functional decline, and long-term arthritis


Classification


      
      Patellofemoral instability is classified descriptively. These classifications are listed below:
    

Acute (first dislocation)Subluxation or dislocationTraumaticPatellar instabilityRecurrentHabitual dislocation - involuntary dislocation of the patellaPassive patellar dislocation - with the aid of apprehension maneuverSyndromic - patellar dislocation associated with a neuromuscular disorder, connective tissue disorder, or syndrome


Mechanism


Traumatic mechanisms can occur with a direct blow with a knee-to-knee collision or a helmet to the side of the knee injuryNoncontact twisting injury with the knee extended and the foot externally rotated


Evaluation


Presentation:  Patient age and gender More likely in femalesMore likely in younger age groups (10-17 years old) Record the number of previous dislocation or subluxation eventsComplaints of instability History of general ligamentous laxityAny previous surgeryPain location Anterior knee pain  Physical Examination: Examination will evaluate a number of areas. Evaluate overall limb alignmentHip and knee rotation should be noted Excessive femoral anteversion will show the patient's toes pointed in or ""pigeon toed"" Presence of large hemarthrosis Evidence of an acute injuryThe absence of signs of trauma supports a chronic ligamentous laxity mechanism or a habitual mechanism Medial-sided tenderness over the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL)Increase in passive patellar translation compared to the contralateral side Midline is considered '0' quadrants of movementNormal is < 2 quadrants of patellar translationLateral translation of the medial border of the patella to the lateral edge of the trochlea is '2' quadrants of motion and considered abnormal Apprehension sign - patella apprehension with passive lateral translation results in guarding and lack of a firm endpointJ sign - excessive lateral translation in extension, which then causes the patella to ""pop"" into the trochlear groove as the patella engages the trochlea early in flexionAssess the Q-angle The angle formed by a line from the ASIS to the center of the patella and from the center of the patella to the tibial tubercleThe Q-angle in full extension can be falsely normal because the patella is not engaged in the trochlea and not on tension. Therefore it is recommended to assess the Q-angle in slight flexion, which is more reliable and accurate.   Imaging: Radiographic examination will divulge several factors. Radiographs will rule out loose bodies Most common is the medial patellar facetLateral femoral condyle AP radiographs Best for evaluating overall lower extremity alignment Lateral radiographs Patellar height (Patella Alta versus Baja) Blumensaats line should extend to the inferior pole of the patella at 30 degrees of knee flexionMultiple ratios can be calculated and give an idea about the level of the patella. Ideally, the following ratio should be calculated with the knee in 30 degrees of flexion. Either on a lateral radiograph, Sagittal CT, or MRI images.Insall-Salvati ratio (0.8 - 1.2) It is the ratio of the patellar tendon length to the length of the patella (Figure 2) If the ratio is >1.2, this indicates Patella Alta Blackburn-Peel ratio (0.5-1) It is the ratio of the perpendicular distance between the tibial plateau and patellar articular surface to the length of the patella articular surface. (Figure 3) A ratio >1 indicates Patella Alta Caton-Deschamps - (0.6-1.3) It is the ratio of the distance between the most inferior point of the patella articular surface to the anterior angle of the tibial plateau and the length of the patellar articular surface. ( Figure 4). A ratio > 1.3 indicates Patella Alta The Caton-Deschamps and Blackburn-Peel measurements have higher reliability and can show change after a tibial tubercle osteotomy is performed Patellar tiltTrochlear dysplasia Crossing sign - seen on lateral radiograph, the trochlear groove lies in the same plane as the anterior border of the lateral femoral condyle Represents a flat trochlear groove Double contour sign - the anterior border of the lateral femoral condyle lies anterior to the anterior border of the medial femoral condyle Represents a convex trochlear groove/hypoplastic medial femoral condyle Supratrochlear spur  Sunrise/merchant views Best assessment for patellar tiltLateral patellofemoral angle A line parallel to the lateral patellar facet and a line drawn across the posterior femoral condylesThe normal angle is >11 degrees opening laterally Congruence angle is an index of subluxation Measured from a line through the apex of the patella to a line bisecting the trochleaIf the congruence angle is lateral to the congruence line, it is considered positiveIf the congruence angle is medial to the congruence line, it is considered negativeThe normal angle is < (-)6 meaning the more positive the angle, the more subluxed the patella is laterally  CT scan Evaluates femoral anteversionEvaluation of tibial rotationTT-TG distance (tibial tubercle to trochlear groove) Must be measured on axial images - it is calculated by taking a line on axial CT perpendicular to the posterior femoral condyles through the trochlear notch and a line through the middle of the tibial tubercleTT-TG distance is normally around 9 mmTT-TG distance > 20mm is abnormal and has > 90% association with patellar instability  MRI Evaluation of loose bodies Osteochondral lesionsThe medial patellar facet is the most commonLateral femoral condyle bone bruisingMost of the traumatic lesions occur during re-location impact Best for assessing MPFL Location of injury The most common injury occurs at the femoral origin (Schottles point)Patellar attachment MidsubstanceCombination    


Treatment


Nonoperative  Closed reduction (majority spontaneously reduce on their own), NSAIDs, activity modification, and physical therapy Indications: First-time dislocationNo loose bodies or articular damageNo osteochondral fragmentsHabitual dislocatorsPatients with connective tissue disease - Ehlers Danlos Physical therapy should focus on closed chain exercises and quadriceps strengthening. Core hip strengthening and gluteal muscle strengthening will improve external rotators of the hip, thus externally rotating the femur and decreasing the Q-angle. Patella sleeve - 'J' sleevePatellar taping  Operative  General indications for surgery: Osteochondral injury with loose bodyChronic instability Failure of nonsurgical treatment Arthroscopic debridement with removal of loose bodies Indications: Loose bodies or osteochondral damage on imaging Open reduction internal fixation if there is sufficient bone available for fixation Screws and pins  Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) repair Indications: Acute first-time dislocation with a bony fragment Direct repair with surgery can be performed within the first days after injuryNo study supports this method over nonoperative treatment  MPFL reconstruction with autograft versus allograft Indications: Recurrent instability and no malalignment or trochlear dysplasia  Gracillis and semitendinosus commonly usedFemoral origin can be reliably found (Schottles point) Schottle point is described as 1 mm anterior to the posterior cortex line, 2.5 mm distal to the posterior origin of the medial femoral condyle, and proximal to the posterior point of Blumensaats line  Tensioning the graft should be done between 60 to 90 degrees of knee flexion is recommended  Fulkerson-type osteotomy (anterior and medial tibial tubercle transfer) Indications: Malalignment - Patellofemoral maltracking with degenerative changes on the distal and lateral aspects of the patella TT-TG > 20 mm Decreases pressure on the lateral patellar facet and overall trochlea Fulkerson showed poorer results with Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 lesions and lesions in the center of the trochlea or medial aspect of the trochleaLikely will fail when there are large central grade 3 or 4 lesions on the trochlea or medial, proximal, or diffuse patella arthritis Lateral soft tissue release The lateral release has been shown to be ineffective for the treatment of patellar instabilityUsed for lateral compression syndrome where there is combined or isolated patellar tilt or excessive tightness after medialization procedureUsually, this is combined with a medialization procedure and not done in isolation  Trochleoplasty - sulcus deepening of the distal femoral trochlea Limited use in the U.S. due to serious irreversible articular and subchondral injury to the trochleaIndicated for abnormal patellar tracking with J sign caused by femoral trochlear dysplasiaRadiographic evidence of trochlear dysplasiaThe cancellous bone is exposed in the trochlea, and a strip of cortical bone on the edge of the trochlea is elevated. The new trochlea sulcus is created, and the trochlear bone shell is impacted and secured to the new sulcus fixed with staples or sutures.","Steve Wolfe

Ellis-van Creveld Syndrome,"Clinical characteristics:
        
      
      Ellis-van Creveld (EVC) syndrome is characterized by postaxial polydactyly of the hands, disproportionate short stature with short limbs, dystrophic and/or hypoplastic nails, dental and oral manifestations, congenital heart disease, and radiologic abnormalities (narrow chest, short ribs, short tubular bones, bulbous ends of the proximal ulnae and distal radii, carpal and metacarpal fusions, cone-shaped epiphyses of phalanges, small iliac crests, acetabular spur projections [trident ilia], and lateral slanting of the tibial plateau). Other less common and more variable features include postaxial polydactyly of the feet, upper lip defect, and developmental delay.
    


          Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      The diagnosis of EVC syndrome is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in DYNC2H1, DYNC2LI1, EVC, EVC2, GLI, SMO, or WDR35 or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PRKACA or PRKACB identified by molecular genetic testing.
    


          Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: Surgical amputation for polydactyly if desired; surgical correction of genu valgum as needed; physical therapy as needed; mechanical ventilation may be required in the neonatal period in those with severe restrictive lung disease; orthodontic and/or surgical treatment of dental anomalies; standard treatment for congenital heart disease; developmental services as needed; surgical correction of genital urinary malformations as needed; standard treatment for hearing loss.
    

Surveillance: Monitor growth at least annually throughout childhood; orthopedic evaluation with radiographic assessment as needed; physical and rehabilitation medicine evaluation as needed; assessment for manifestations of respiratory failure and/or restrictive lung disease as needed; monitor for dental eruption, overcrowding, and dental morphology annually throughout childhood; echocardiogram as needed; monitor developmental progress and educational needs at each visit until adulthood; hearing evaluation as needed if hearing loss is present.
    

Pregnancy management: Cesarean delivery is recommended in pregnant women with EVC syndrome who have pelvic/hip abnormalities.
    


          Genetic counseling:
        
      
      EVC syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in DYNC2H1, DYNC2LI1, EVC, EVC2, GLI, SMO, or WDR35 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. EVC syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in PRKACA or PRKACB (accounting for 2% of affected individuals) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
    

Autosomal recessive inheritance: If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an EVC syndrome-related pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Once the EVC syndrome-related pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","Jorge Diogo Da Silva

Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA,"Clinical characteristics:
        
      
      The phenotypic spectrum of mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is a continuum that ranges from a severe and rapidly progressive early-onset form to a slowly progressive later-onset form. Children with MPS IVA typically have no distinctive clinical findings at birth. The severe form is usually apparent between ages one and three years, often first manifesting as kyphoscoliosis, genu valgum (knock-knee), and pectus carinatum; the slowly progressive form may not become evident until late childhood or adolescence, often first manifesting as hip problems (pain, stiffness, and Legg Perthes disease). Progressive bone and joint involvement leads to short stature, and eventually to disabling pain and arthritis. Involvement of other organ systems can lead to significant morbidity, including respiratory compromise, obstructive sleep apnea, valvular heart disease, hearing impairment, visual impairment from corneal clouding, dental abnormalities, and hepatomegaly. Compression of the spinal cord is a common complication that results in neurologic impairment. Children with MPS IVA have normal intellectual abilities at the outset of the disease.
    


          Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      The diagnosis of MPS IVA is established in a proband by identification of low N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase (GALNS) enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts or leukocytes or by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in GALNS on molecular genetic testing.
    


          Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: Enzyme replacement therapy (elosulfase alfa) is available, although the data on long-term effects of this treatment on the skeletal and non-skeletal features of MPS IVA are limited. Evaluation and management of individuals with MPS IVA are best undertaken by multiple specialists, coordinated by a physician specializing in the care of persons with complex medical problems. Physiatrists, physical therapists, and occupational therapists help optimize mobility and autonomy. Psychological support can optimize coping skills and quality of life; educational professionals can optimize the learning environment for a medically fragile individual. Upper-extremity management may include stabilizing external wrist splints or partial or complete wrist fusion. Surgical intervention is often required for lower-extremity malalignment, hip subluxation and/or hip pain, upper cervical spine instability, and/or progressive thoracolumbar kyphosis. Cardiac valve involvement may require valve replacement. Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended for those with a prosthetic cardiac valve, prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair, or previous infective endocarditis. Upper-airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea are managed by removal of enlarged tonsils and adenoids; diffuse narrowing of the airway may require positive airway pressure and/or tracheostomy. All affected individuals should receive influenza and pneumococcal immunizations as well as routine immunizations. Anesthesia management by an experienced anesthesiologist. Potential pre- and postoperative anesthetic concerns secondary to spine anomalies and difficult airway management need to be anticipated. Optimize nutrition and provide adequate vitamin D and calcium. The outcome following keratoplasty for corneal opacification varies. Dental care to prevent cavities and orthodontic management as needed. Hearing loss is often treated initially with ventilation tubes and later with hearing aids. School accommodations as needed to prevent physical injury.
    

Surveillance: For all individuals: physical examination at least every six months. Annual assessment of: pain severity; disease burden including quality of life and activities of daily living, endurance tests to evaluate functional status of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems; upper and lower extremities for functionality and malalignment, hips for dysplasia/subluxation, and thoracolumbar spine for kyphosis. Neurologic examination every six months to assess for spinal cord compression; yearly whole-spine MRI in neutral position and cervical spine flexion-extension MRI if the results are inconclusive; spine radiographs every two to three years. Annual assessment of heart rate; electrocardiogram and echocardiogram every one to three years depending on disease course. Polysomnography every three years to assess for obstructive sleep apnea; annual pulmonary function in children older than age five years until growth stops, then every two to three years. Monitor nutritional status using MPS IVA-specific growth charts. Perform vision and eye exam at least annually, dental evaluation every six to 12 months, and annual audiogram. For those on enzyme replacement therapy: annual assessment of pain, disease burden parameters, and pulmonary function tests; urine keratan sulfate or total glycosaminoglycans every six months.
    

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Excessive weight gain; beta-blockers.
    


          Genetic counseling:
        
      
      MPS IVA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a GALNS pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the GALNS pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","Debra S Regier

EXOC6B-Related Spondyloepimetaphyseal Dysplasia with Joint Laxity,"Clinical characteristics:
        
EXOC6B-related spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity (EXOC6B-SEMD-JL) is characterized by multiple joint dislocations, joint laxity, genu valgum, short stature, and skeletal dysplasia. Joint dislocations of the hips and knees are present at birth in all individuals reported to date. Dislocations can also occur at the elbows, wrists, ankles, and patellae. Growth deficiency develops postnatally. Short neck, scoliosis, kyphosis, and hyperlordosis are reported. The fingers are slender (leptodactyly). Radiographic manifestations include delayed carpal/tarsal bone ossification, gracile short tubular bones, metaphyseal and epiphyseal dysplasia, slender ribs, and spondylar dysplasia (irregular vertebral end plates, narrow interpedicular distance of the lumbar spine, and modest platyspondyly) with age-dependent evolution.

"Immediate Effect of Ankle Mobilization on Range of Motion, Dynamic Knee Valgus, and Knee Pain in Women With Patellofemoral Pain and Ankle Dorsiflexion Restriction: A Randomized Controlled Trial With 48-Hour Follow-Up","Context:
        
      
      Restriction in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) has been previously associated with excessive dynamic knee valgus. This, in turn, has been correlated with knee pain in women with patellofemoral pain.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To investigate the immediate effect of 3 ankle mobilization techniques on dorsiflexion ROM, dynamic knee valgus, knee pain, and patient perceptions of improvement in women with patellofemoral pain and ankle dorsiflexion restriction.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Randomized controlled trial with 3 arms.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Biomechanics laboratory.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      A total of 117 women with patellofemoral pain who display ankle dorsiflexion restriction were divided into 3 groups: ankle mobilization with anterior tibia glide (n = 39), ankle mobilization with posterior tibia glide (n = 39), and ankle mobilization with anterior and posterior tibia glide (n = 39).
    


          Intervention(s):
        
      
      The participants received a single session of ankle mobilization with movement technique.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Dorsiflexion ROM (weight-bearing lunge test), dynamic knee valgus (frontal plane projection angle), knee pain (numeric pain rating scale), and patient perceptions of improvement (global perceived effect scale). The outcome measures were collected at the baseline, immediate postintervention (immediate reassessment), and 48 hours postintervention (48 h reassessment).
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no significant differences between the 3 treatment groups regarding dorsiflexion ROM and patient perceptions of improvement. Compared with mobilization with anterior and posterior tibia glide, mobilization with anterior tibia glide promoted greater increase in dynamic knee valgus (P = .02) and greater knee pain reduction (P = .02) at immediate reassessment. Also compared with mobilization with anterior and posterior tibia glide, mobilization with posterior tibia glide promoted greater knee pain reduction (P < .01) at immediate reassessment.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In our sample, the direction of the tibia glide in ankle mobilization accounted for significant changes only in dynamic knee valgus and knee pain in the immediate reassessment.","Bruno Augusto Lima Coelho, Helena Larissa das Neves Rodrigues, Gabriel Peixoto Leão Almeida, Sílvia Maria Amado João",J Sport Rehabil,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//33373976/,2025-06-03 09:01:57,PubMed,0.08035714285714286,0.4439775910364146,neutral,2,0.3871061988875457,-0.3569717247840055
Therapies for the bone in mucopolysaccharidoses,"Patients with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) have accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in multiple tissues which may cause coarse facial features, mental retardation, recurrent ear and nose infections, inguinal and umbilical hernias, hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal deformities. Clinical features related to bone lesions may include marked short stature, cervical stenosis, pectus carinatum, small lungs, joint rigidity (but laxity for MPS IV), kyphoscoliosis, lumbar gibbus, and genu valgum. Patients with MPS are often wheelchair-bound and physical handicaps increase with age as a result of progressive skeletal dysplasia, abnormal joint mobility, and osteoarthritis, leading to 1) stenosis of the upper cervical region, 2) restrictive small lung, 3) hip dysplasia, 4) restriction of joint movement, and 5) surgical complications. Patients often need multiple orthopedic procedures including cervical decompression and fusion, carpal tunnel release, hip reconstruction and replacement, and femoral or tibial osteotomy through their lifetime. Current measures to intervene in bone disease progression are not perfect and palliative, and improved therapies are urgently required. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and gene therapy are available or in development for some types of MPS. Delivery of sufficient enzyme to bone, especially avascular cartilage, to prevent or ameliorate the devastating skeletal dysplasias remains an unmet challenge. The use of an anti-inflammatory drug is also under clinical study. Therapies should start at a very early stage prior to irreversible bone lesion, and damage since the severity of skeletal dysplasia is associated with level of activity during daily life. This review illustrates a current overview of therapies and their impact for bone lesions in MPS including ERT, HSCT, gene therapy, and anti-inflammatory drugs.","Shunji Tomatsu

Lower Extremity Abnormalities in Children,"Rotational and angular variations of the lower extremities in children are common conditions seen in primary care. These visits are often due to parental concerns about the appearance of their child's lower extremities. Common variations include intoeing (metatarsus adductus, internal tibial torsion, and femoral anteversion); out-toeing (external tibial torsion, femoral retroversion, and pes planus); and angular variations (genu varum and genu valgum). History, particularly age of onset; duration; progression; appearance and impact; prenatal and birth history; nutritional deficiencies; growth and development; medical and family history of related disorders, including rheumatologic, autoimmune, or neurologic conditions, can help differentiate normal variations from true deformities. In addition to a routine physical examination, a focused examination measuring a variety of parameters, such as foot progression angle, internal and external hip rotation, thigh-foot angle, joint laxity, and other condition-specific tests should be performed. If an underlying cause is identified, it should be treated; however, these conditions typically do not require further evaluation or treatment if measurements are within age-related normal ranges and patients are asymptomatic, and parents can be reassured that they are benign. There is minimal evidence to support the use of orthotics or braces. Referral to a pediatric orthopedist should be considered when measurements are more than 2 standard deviations outside of normal values, children have pain, or function is affected.","Drew C Baird

Wedge-less oblique supracondylar femoral osteotomy and casting for genu valgum in older children and young adults,"Background:
        
      
      Genu valgum is one of the commonest deformities seen by the orthopaedicians. The most common cause is idiopathic but genu valgum secondary to nutritional deficiency is also fairly common in developing and third world countries. Supracondylar osteotomy and internal fixation with plate and screws, is the treatment of choice in older children and young adults, which is costly, requires a wide exposure, a second surgery for implant removal and risk of infection is more. This study was undertaken to measure the outcome of simple oblique percutaneous wedge-less metaphyseal supracondylar osteotomy of the distal femur and casting in older children and adolescents with Genu Valgum in a small centre catering mostly to patients from middle and low income households.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Patients aged between 12 and 22 years with genu valgum deformity with a tibiofemoral angle ≥15°, and an intermalleolar distance of more than 7 cm in unilateral and more than 10 cm in bilateral cases, who are not amenable to be treated with guided growth techniques, were included. Patients having knee instability, restriction of knee range of motion, genu recurvatum, tibial deformity component, open physis, were excluded from the study. The correction was undertaken by a simple supracondylar wedge-less metaphyseal short oblique osteotomy of the distal femur followed by immobilization with a long leg plaster of Paris cast. Functional outcome was assessed using Böstman et al. score.
    


          Results:
        
      
      46 limbs in 29 patients with a mean age of 14.5 years were operated. The mean follow-up of patients was 6 months. The preoperative radiological tibiofemoral angle (TFA) had a mean value of 19.89° which improved to a mean of 5.31° postoperatively. Intermalleolar distance (IMD) improved from a mean of 13.81 cm to 3.15 cm post-correction. Mean Lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA) improved from 77.11° to 87.20°. Knee score was excellent in all patients at 3 months and 6 months post intervention. There were no serious complications except superficial plaster sores in 4 patients, which healed uneventfully and temporary restriction of knee range of motion in 5 patients. All patients achieved a full range of knee motion after physical therapy.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Supracondylar wedge-less short oblique metaphyseal distal femoral osteotomy and immobilization with plaster of Paris cast is a simple, cheap, safe & viable option for the correction of genu valgum deformity originating from distal femur, with minimal complications in older children and adolescents with limited growth potential, especially in low income countries and small centres.","Navneet Rustagi

Differences in onset time between the vastus medialis and lateralis during stair stepping in individuals with genu varum or valgum,"[Purpose] We investigated the difference in onset time between the vastus medialis and lateralis according to knee alignment during stair ascent and descent to examine the effects of knee alignment on the quadriceps during stair stepping. [Subjects] Fifty-two adults (20 with genu varum, 12 with genu valgum, and 20 controls) were enrolled. Subjects with > 4 cm between the medial epicondyles of the knees were placed in the genu varum group, whereas subjects with > 4 cm between the medial malleolus of the ankle were placed in the genu valgum group. [Methods] Surface electromyography was used to measure the onset times of the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis during stair ascent and descent. [Results] The vastus lateralis showed more delayed firing than the vastus medialis in the genu varum group, whereas vastus medialis firing was more delayed than vastus lateralis firing in the genu valgum group. Significant differences in onset time were detected between stair ascent and descent in the genu varum and valgum groups. [Conclusion] Genu varum and valgum affect quadriceps firing during stair stepping. Therefore, selective rehabilitation training of the quadriceps femoris should be considered to prevent pain or knee malalignment deformities.","Seol Park

"Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia, Autosomal Dominant","Clinical characteristics:
        
      
      Autosomal dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) presents in early childhood, usually with pain in the hips and/or knees after exercise. Affected children report fatigue with long-distance walking. Waddling gait may be present. Adult height is either in the lower range of normal or mildly shortened. The limbs are relatively short in comparison to the trunk. Pain and joint deformity progress, resulting in early-onset osteoarthritis, particularly of the large weight-bearing joints.
    


          Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      The diagnosis of autosomal dominant MED is established in a proband with typical clinical and radiographic findings and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in COL9A1, COL9A2, COL9A3, COMP, or MATN3 identified by molecular genetic testing.
    


          Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: For pain control, a combination of analgesics and physiotherapy including hydrotherapy; referral to a rheumatologist or pain specialist as needed; consideration of realignment osteotomy and/or acetabular osteotomy to limit joint destruction and development of osteoarthritis. Consider total joint arthroplasty if the degenerative hip changes cause uncontrollable pain/dysfunction. Offer psychosocial support addressing issues of short stature, chronic pain, disability, and employment.
    

Surveillance: Evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon for chronic pain and/or limb deformities (genu varum, genu valgum).
    

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Obesity; exercise causing repetitive strain on affected joints.
    


          Genetic counseling:
        
      
      By definition, autosomal dominant MED is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Many individuals with autosomal dominant MED have an affected parent. The proportion of individuals with autosomal dominant MED who have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant MED has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the autosomal dominant MED-related pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","Michael D Briggs

Does soccer participation lead to genu varum?,"Little is known about the relationship between sport participation and body adaptations during growth. Our aim was to investigate whether soccer participation in youth is associated with the degree of genu varum. The design was a retrospective cohort study. Three hundred and thirty-six male soccer players, and 458 male non-soccer players (aged from 8 to 18) were recruited and included in the study. The intercondylar (IC) or intermalleolar (IM) distance were clinically measured with a specifically designed instrument. The results of this study revealed a statistically significant increase in degree of genu varum in both groups from the age of 14. However, at the age of 16-18 years a significant higher degree of genu varum was observed in the soccer players compared to the non-soccer players (P = 0.028). Intense soccer participation increases the degree of genu varum in males from the age of 16. Since genu varum predisposes to injuries, efforts to reduce the development of genu varum in male soccer players are warranted.","Erik Witvrouw

Use of Postural Reconstruction® physiotherapy to treat an adolescent with asymmetric bilateral genu varum and idiopathic scoliosis,"Objective:
        
      
      To document the effect of Postural Reconstruction® physiotherapy on two postural disorders commonly observed in adolescents: genu varum and idiopathic scoliosis.
    


          Patient and methods:
        
      
      A case report on a 16-year-old boy suffering from knee pain and presenting with bilateral genu varum and mild scoliosis. At the initial evaluation (T0), the intercondylar space was 7 cm and the Cobb angles for the right lumbar curve and left thoracic curve were 18° and 13°, respectively. The boy was treated with Postural Reconstruction(®), a neuromuscular physiotherapy intervention using facilitation/inhibition techniques. The outcomes used to quantify the effect of 6 months (T1), 12 months (T2) and 26 months (T3) of treatment were pain levels, the intercondylar space, the lumbar gibbosity and the lumbar and thoracic Cobb angles.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The knee pain disappeared rapidly. At T3, the intercondylar space had decreased by 4 cm, the lumbar gibbosity angle had decreased by 2° and the lumbar and thoracic Cobb angles had decreased by 8° and 7°, respectively.

Is genu varum a risk factor for the prevalence and severity of achilles tendinopathy? A cross-sectional study of Nigerian elite track and field athletes,"Background:
        
      
      Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is one of the most frequently reported ankle and foot overuse injuries. Prior studies have reported altered biomechanical variables of the lower limb as risk factors for the prevalence and severity of AT in athletes, especially in Caucasians, but there are few reports on African elite athletes. Because it is established that anthropometric and biomechanical values vary with racial disposition, this study was designed to investigate the association between selected physical and biomechanical variables of the lower limb and the prevalence and severity of AT in Nigerian elite track and field athletes.
    


          Subjects and methods:
        
      
      Eighty-five elite Nigerian track and field athletes participated in this cross-sectional study. Biomechanical variables of Q-angle, tibial torsion, limb-length discrepancy (LLD) and foot posture index (FPI) were evaluated using standard procedures. The presence of AT was confirmed with ultrasonography and clinical assessments, whereas the severity was evaluated with VISA-A questionnaire. Inferential statistics of Chi-square was used to determine the association between prevalence of AT and the biomechanical variables.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The prevalence of AT was 15.3%, made up of participants who tested positive to both clinical test and ultrasound scan. There was no significant association between AT and LLD, tibial torsion and FPI. Most of the participants with AT had genu varum, which was significantly associated with both the prevalence and severity of AT.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      It was concluded that genu varum had a significant association with both the prevalence and severity of AT in elite Nigerian track and field athletes.","Ayoola Ibifubara Aiyegbusi

Assessing the accuracy of measuring leg length discrepancy and genu varum/valgum using a markerless motion analysis system,"Aims:
        
      
      Markerless motion analysis (MMA) systems are being used extensively in the area of sports medicine and physiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to compare leg length measurements (LLM) and varus/valgus knee measurements (VVM) performed clinically, radiologically and using MMA in patients being assessed for potential total knee arthroplasty (TKR).between mean LLM calculated clinically, radiologically and using MMA (all p < 0.05).
    


          Discussion & conclusion:
        
      
      Discrepanices exist in LLM and VVM when evaluated using clinical, radiological and MMA modalities. Therefore, this study suggests that MMA alone may not be a suitable modality for assessment of patients for TKR, with a combination of two or more evaluation modalities recommended at present.

This overview summarizes the most common orthopedic problems in overweight children and obesity and highlights the treatment options in addition to weight reduction and physiotherapy leaded activation. In early infancy a persitent genu varum may be seen as a sign of Blount disease. In the school ages flat feet or persistent knock-knees has a higher incidence in overweight children. The incidence for back pain and osteoporosis are related with overweight and obese. At puberty, the slipped capital epiphysis, which always needs a surgical management, is mostly related to overweight/obese.

Hereditary disorders mimicking and/or causing premature osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease, causing considerable disability and impairment of quality of life. Hereditary osteochondrodysplasias and some inborn errors of metabolism may mimic or cause premature osteoarthritis. Osteochondrodysplasias usually cause joint deformities, such as coxa vara or genu varum, which can cause abnormal biomechanics. In most of these disorders, the articular cartilage is originally defective as a result of genetically determined collagen or matrix protein abnormalities, or the deposition of mucopolysaccharides. In the case of inborn errors of metabolism, the pathological process affects healthy articular structures, causing secondary osteoarthritis. In alkaptonuria, the pathological deposition of polymerized homogenistic acid causes defective changes in cartilage, articular capsule and tendons. In Wilson's disease, the premature osteoarthritis might be caused by the copper deposition. It is worth paying attention to these rare disorders, even when they are mild or incomplete, because early diagnosis can lead to prevention and effective treatment. In addition, research is discovering the specific gene defects and molecular abnormalities that are responsible for disease expression. This may in turn lead to opportunities for prenatal diagnosis; thus, genetic counselling and gene replacement therapy may be a realistic possibility in the near future.","G Bálint

The influence of hip rotations on muscle activity during unilateral weight-bearing exercises in individuals with and without genu varum: A cross-sectional study,"Objectives:
        
      
      Hip rotation can influence gluteus medius (Gmed) muscle activity in individuals with genu varum (GV). This study examined different hip rotation positions on muscle activity during unilateral weight-bearing exercises in individuals with and without GV.
    


          Design:

          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Surface electromyography measured Gmed and tensor fascia latae (TFL) activity during pelvic drop (PD) and wall press (WP) exercises with different hip rotations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the control group, WP with external rotation produced greater Gmed/TFL activity compared to other rotation positions. No difference was found for Gmed/TFL with PD in controls. In the GV group, Gmed activity increased with internal rotation in PD and WP; TFL activity increased only with external rotation in WP. Internal hip rotation produced higher Gmed/TFL activity than other positions in the GV group during both exercises. Greater Gmed/TFL activity was observed in the control group than GV during PD with external rotation, and WP with neutral positioning and external rotation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      WP with external rotation in controls, and PD and WP with internal hip rotation in subjects with GV, are effective exercises to optimize GMed/TFL activity.","Amir Letafatkar

Functional Recovery in a Patient of Abnormal Left Parieto-Occipital Encephalomalacia With Gliosis-Associated Genu Varum Deformity: A Case Report,"Parieto-occipital encephalomalacia is a macroscopic appearance of the brain with loss of cerebral parenchyma associated with gliosis in the brain's anatomical structures. It occurs because of the liquefaction of brain parenchymal necrosis after cerebral ischemia, infection, and haemorrhages. It is often surrounded by glial cell proliferation in response to damage. Rehabilitation after the manifestation of neurological function must be tailored, and well-coordinated intervention must be formulated. We present a case study of a 77-year-old male with parieto-occipital encephalomalacia associated with genu varum deformity with a complaint of generalized weakness, vertigo, giddiness, and fall with one episode of a seizure attack. Further, bilateral genu varum deformity was noted on the knees. Encephalomalcia is associated with vitamin D deficiency. The physiotherapy rehabilitation consisted of resolving the symptoms of the patient, along with working on strengthening weak muscles of the genu varum deformity of the patient. The proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) method is a popular rehabilitation strategy for regaining motor function. Numerous outcome measures were used to monitor the patient's progress. Outcome measures such as the tone grading scale (TGS), motor assessment scale (MAS), dynamic gait index (DGI), Barthel index (BI), and world health-related quality-of-life (WHORQOL) scales were used. The rehabilitation lasted for six weeks. Tele-rehabilitation also plays a crucial impact in the recovery of patients. By the end of our rehabilitation, the patient significantly improved in performing activities of daily living and improved his quality of life. Tele-rehabilitation helped us stay connected with the patient.","Sejal Gandhi

Patient characteristics that predict progression of knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review of prognostic studies,"Objective:
        
      
      To identify, by systematic review, patient characteristics that can be used by health care practitioners to predict the likelihood of knee osteoarthritis (OA) progression.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A search was conducted of the electronic databases Medline, EMBase, CINAHL, AMED, and Web of Science in November 2010. Two reviewers screened articles using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Study participants were adults with established knee OA. Outcome measures for disease progression were change in pain or function or deterioration in radiographic features. Included studies identified clinically relevant prognostic factors at baseline and reported a statistical association with outcome. Minimum followup was 1 year. Articles were assessed for bias, and strength of evidence was summarized for potential predictors of progression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty studies were included, of which 26 were of high quality. Age, varus knee alignment, presence of OA in multiple joints, and radiographic features had strong evidence as predictors of knee OA progression. Body mass index was a strong predictor for long-term progression (>3 years). Moderate participation in physical activity was not associated with progression. Numerous variables had limited or conflicting evidence.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Relatively few predictive variables have strong supporting evidence; numerous variables have limited or conflicting evidence. All variables with strong evidence can be easily evaluated and utilized in clinical practice. Existing knowledge should be developed in future research, particularly in cases where study numbers are low or findings are limited or conflicting. Standardized measurement of potential predictors and outcome measures is recommended.","Cathy M Chapple

Lower Extremity Abnormalities in Children,"Leg and foot problems in childhood are common causes of parental concern. Rotational problems include intoeing and out-toeing. Intoeing is most common in infants and young children. Intoeing is caused by metatarsus adductus, internal tibial torsion, and femoral anteversion. Out-toeing is less common than intoeing and occurs more often in older children. Out-toeing is caused by external tibial torsion and femoral retroversion. Angular problems include genu varum (bowleg) and genu valgum (knock knee). With pes planus (flatfoot), the arch of the foot is usually flexible rather than rigid. A history and physical examination that include torsional profile tests and angular measurements are usually sufficient to evaluate patients with lower extremity abnormalities. Most children who present with lower extremity problems have normal rotational and angular findings (i.e., within two standard deviations of the mean). Lower extremity abnormalities that are within normal measurements resolve spontaneously as the child grows. Radiologic studies are not routinely required, except to exclude pathologic conditions. Orthotics are not beneficial. Orthopedic referral is often not necessary. Rarely, surgery is required in patients older than eight years who have severe deformities that cause dysfunction.","Caitlyn M Rerucha

Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA,"Clinical characteristics:
        
      
      The phenotypic spectrum of mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is a continuum that ranges from a severe and rapidly progressive early-onset form to a slowly progressive later-onset form. Children with MPS IVA typically have no distinctive clinical findings at birth. The severe form is usually apparent between ages one and three years, often first manifesting as kyphoscoliosis, genu valgum (knock-knee), and pectus carinatum; the slowly progressive form may not become evident until late childhood or adolescence, often first manifesting as hip problems (pain, stiffness, and Legg Perthes disease). Progressive bone and joint involvement leads to short stature, and eventually to disabling pain and arthritis. Involvement of other organ systems can lead to significant morbidity, including respiratory compromise, obstructive sleep apnea, valvular heart disease, hearing impairment, visual impairment from corneal clouding, dental abnormalities, and hepatomegaly. Compression of the spinal cord is a common complication that results in neurologic impairment. Children with MPS IVA have normal intellectual abilities at the outset of the disease.
    


          Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      The diagnosis of MPS IVA is established in a proband by identification of low N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase (GALNS) enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts or leukocytes or by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in GALNS on molecular genetic testing.
    


          Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: Enzyme replacement therapy (elosulfase alfa) is available, although the data on long-term effects of this treatment on the skeletal and non-skeletal features of MPS IVA are limited. Evaluation and management of individuals with MPS IVA are best undertaken by multiple specialists, coordinated by a physician specializing in the care of persons with complex medical problems. Physiatrists, physical therapists, and occupational therapists help optimize mobility and autonomy. Psychological support can optimize coping skills and quality of life; educational professionals can optimize the learning environment for a medically fragile individual. Upper-extremity management may include stabilizing external wrist splints or partial or complete wrist fusion. Surgical intervention is often required for lower-extremity malalignment, hip subluxation and/or hip pain, upper cervical spine instability, and/or progressive thoracolumbar kyphosis. Cardiac valve involvement may require valve replacement. Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended for those with a prosthetic cardiac valve, prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair, or previous infective endocarditis. Upper-airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea are managed by removal of enlarged tonsils and adenoids; diffuse narrowing of the airway may require positive airway pressure and/or tracheostomy. All affected individuals should receive influenza and pneumococcal immunizations as well as routine immunizations. Anesthesia management by an experienced anesthesiologist. Potential pre- and postoperative anesthetic concerns secondary to spine anomalies and difficult airway management need to be anticipated. Optimize nutrition and provide adequate vitamin D and calcium. The outcome following keratoplasty for corneal opacification varies. Dental care to prevent cavities and orthodontic management as needed. Hearing loss is often treated initially with ventilation tubes and later with hearing aids. School accommodations as needed to prevent physical injury.
    

Surveillance: For all individuals: physical examination at least every six months. Annual assessment of: pain severity; disease burden including quality of life and activities of daily living, endurance tests to evaluate functional status of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems; upper and lower extremities for functionality and malalignment, hips for dysplasia/subluxation, and thoracolumbar spine for kyphosis. Neurologic examination every six months to assess for spinal cord compression; yearly whole-spine MRI in neutral position and cervical spine flexion-extension MRI if the results are inconclusive; spine radiographs every two to three years. Annual assessment of heart rate; electrocardiogram and echocardiogram every one to three years depending on disease course. Polysomnography every three years to assess for obstructive sleep apnea; annual pulmonary function in children older than age five years until growth stops, then every two to three years. Monitor nutritional status using MPS IVA-specific growth charts. Perform vision and eye exam at least annually, dental evaluation every six to 12 months, and annual audiogram. For those on enzyme replacement therapy: annual assessment of pain, disease burden parameters, and pulmonary function tests; urine keratan sulfate or total glycosaminoglycans every six months.
    

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Excessive weight gain; beta-blockers.
    


          Genetic counseling:
        
      
      MPS IVA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a GALNS pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the GALNS pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","Debra S Regier

Evaluation of surgical techniques in survival rate and complications of zygomatic implants for the rehabilitation of the atrophic edentulous maxilla: a systematic review,"Purpose:
        
      
      To assess the outcome [zygomatic implant (ZI) survival] and complications of the original surgical technique (OST) and an Anatomy-Guided approach (AGA) in the placement of ZI in patients with severely atrophic maxillae.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two independent reviewers conducted an electronic literature search from January 2000 to August 2022. The inclusion criteria were articles reporting at least five patients with severely atrophic edentulous maxilla undergoing placement OST and/or AGA, with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up. Number of patients, defect characteristics, number of ZI, implant details, surgical technique, survival rate, loading protocol, prosthetic rehabilitation, complications, and follow-up period were compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-four studies comprised 2194 ZI in 918 patients with 41 failures. The ZI survival rate was 90.3-100% in OST and 90.4-100% in AGA. Probability of complications with ZI with OST was as follows: sinusitis, 9.53%; soft tissue infection, 7.50%; paresthesia, 10.78%; oroantral fistulas, 4.58%; and direct surgical complication, 6.91%. With AGA, the presenting complications were as follows: sinusitis, 4.39%; soft tissue infection, 4.35%; paresthesia, 0.55%; oroantral fistulas, 1.71%; and direct surgical complication, 1.60%. The prevalence of immediate loading protocol was 22.3% in OST and 89.6% in the AGA. Due to the heterogeneity of studies, statistical comparison was only possible after the descriptive analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Based on the current systematic review, placing ZI in severely atrophic edentulous maxillae rehabilitation with the OST and AGA is associated with a high implant survival rate and surgical complications within a minimum of 6 months follow-up. Complications, including sinusitis and soft tissue infection around the implant, are the most common. The utilization of immediate loading protocol is more observed in AGA than in OST.","Peer W Kämmerer #

"Immediate Effect of Ankle Mobilization on Range of Motion, Dynamic Knee Valgus, and Knee Pain in Women With Patellofemoral Pain and Ankle Dorsiflexion Restriction: A Randomized Controlled Trial With 48-Hour Follow-Up","Context:
        
      
      Restriction in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) has been previously associated with excessive dynamic knee valgus. This, in turn, has been correlated with knee pain in women with patellofemoral pain.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To investigate the immediate effect of 3 ankle mobilization techniques on dorsiflexion ROM, dynamic knee valgus, knee pain, and patient perceptions of improvement in women with patellofemoral pain and ankle dorsiflexion restriction.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Randomized controlled trial with 3 arms.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Biomechanics laboratory.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      A total of 117 women with patellofemoral pain who display ankle dorsiflexion restriction were divided into 3 groups: ankle mobilization with anterior tibia glide (n = 39), ankle mobilization with posterior tibia glide (n = 39), and ankle mobilization with anterior and posterior tibia glide (n = 39).
    


          Intervention(s):
        
      
      The participants received a single session of ankle mobilization with movement technique.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Dorsiflexion ROM (weight-bearing lunge test), dynamic knee valgus (frontal plane projection angle), knee pain (numeric pain rating scale), and patient perceptions of improvement (global perceived effect scale). The outcome measures were collected at the baseline, immediate postintervention (immediate reassessment), and 48 hours postintervention (48 h reassessment).
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no significant differences between the 3 treatment groups regarding dorsiflexion ROM and patient perceptions of improvement. Compared with mobilization with anterior and posterior tibia glide, mobilization with anterior tibia glide promoted greater increase in dynamic knee valgus (P = .02) and greater knee pain reduction (P = .02) at immediate reassessment. Also compared with mobilization with anterior and posterior tibia glide, mobilization with posterior tibia glide promoted greater knee pain reduction (P < .01) at immediate reassessment.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In our sample, the direction of the tibia glide in ankle mobilization accounted for significant changes only in dynamic knee valgus and knee pain in the immediate reassessment.","Bruno Augusto Lima Coelho, Helena Larissa das Neves Rodrigues, Gabriel Peixoto Leão Almeida, Sílvia Maria Amado João",J Sport Rehabil,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//33373976/,2025-06-03 09:02:44,PubMed,0.08035714285714286,0.4439775910364146,neutral,2,0.3871061988875457,-0.3569717247840055
Congenital fibular deficiency,"Congenital fibular deficiency (CFD) is characterized by a wide spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild limb length inequality (LLI) to severe shortening, with foot and ankle deformities and associated anomalies. The etiology of CFD remains unclear. Treatment goals are to achieve normal weight bearing, a functional plantigrade foot, and equal limb length. The recent Birch classification system has been proposed to provide a treatment guide: the functionality of the foot, LLI, and associated anomalies should be taken into account for decision-making. Treatment options include orthosis or epiphysiodesis, Syme or Boyd amputation and prosthetic rehabilitation, limb lengthening procedures, and foot and ankle reconstruction. The outcome of amputation for severe forms of CFD has shown favorable results and fewer complications compared with those of limb lengthening. Nevertheless, advances in the limb lengthening techniques may change our approach to treating patients with CFD and might extend the indications for reconstructive procedures to the treatment of severe LLI and foot deformities.","Reggie C Hamdy, Asim M Makhdom, Neil Saran, John Birch",J Am Acad Orthop Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//24668354/,2025-06-03 09:02:47,PubMed,0.07666666666666666,0.41,neutral,1,0.2511223566192896,0.16354916912687412
[Knee realignment osteotomy in adults],"Background:
        
      
      Nowadays, osteotomy near the knee joint for axial deformities has become an indispensable surgical procedure for joint preservation in the orthopaedic-surgical spectrum. The exact localization and analysis of the deformity are crucial to restoring physiological loading conditions of the entire leg by means of a suitable osteotomy.
    


          Procedures:
        
      
      Thus, above all, the medial ""open-wedge"" osteotomy has established itself as a standard procedure for the treatment of gonarthrosis caused by varus malalignment. Furthermore, the varus closed-wedge osteotomy of the distal femur also shows very good long-term results. Basically, osteotomies close to the knee are causal corrections in which biological and mechanical aspects must be taken into account. Thus, the correct indication, attention to risk factors, and surgical technique determine the long-term success of the procedure. The doctrine of femoral valgus deformity and the resulting lateral arthrosis, on the other hand, must be reconsidered according to the latest knowledge.","Markus Heinecke

Proximal Tibial Recurvatum-Valgus: Analysis and Treatment,"Genu recurvatum-valgus arises from the proximal tibia and poses challenges in its treatment. The etiology of the combined deformities can include physeal trauma (often unrecognized), iatrogenic injury, infection, tumor, Osgood-Schlatter syndrome, skeletal dysplasia, and ligamentous laxity. Both osseous and ligamentous contributions must be recognized for successful treatment. A graphical planning method identifies the true (oblique) plane of deformity. Surgical treatment options include epiphysiodesis to prevent progressive deformity, guided growth, opening-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy, and gradual correction with concomitant limb lengthening using external fixation or motorized internal lengthening. Opening-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy conducted along the true deformity plane is a reliable surgical method for lesser-magnitude deformities. Gradual correction using circular external fixation is considered when the magnitude of correction is greater than 25º or when limb shortening and/or multiplanar deformity is present. After successful surgical management, patients can expect to achieve correction of knee hyperextension, posterior tibial slope, and mechanical axis. Restoration of these parameters re-establishes physiologic loading of the knee. This review illustrates the clinical and radiographic assessment of the deformity, relevant anatomy, and five surgical techniques for the genu recurvatum-valgus deformity of the proximal tibia.","Andrew G Georgiadis

Effects of and Response to Mechanical Loading on the Knee,"Mechanical loading to the knee joint results in a differential response based on the local capacity of the tissues (ligament, tendon, meniscus, cartilage, and bone) and how those tissues subsequently adapt to that load at the molecular and cellular level. Participation in cutting, pivoting, and jumping sports predisposes the knee to the risk of injury. In this narrative review, we describe different mechanisms of loading that can result in excessive loads to the knee, leading to ligamentous, musculotendinous, meniscal, and chondral injuries or maladaptations. Following injury (or surgery) to structures around the knee, the primary goal of rehabilitation is to maximize the patient's response to exercise at the current level of function, while minimizing the risk of re-injury to the healing tissue. Clinicians should have a clear understanding of the specific injured tissue(s), and rehabilitation should be driven by knowledge of tissue-healing constraints, knee complex and lower extremity biomechanics, neuromuscular physiology, task-specific activities involving weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing conditions, and training principles. We provide a practical application for prescribing loading progressions of exercises, functional activities, and mobility tasks based on their mechanical load profile to knee-specific structures during the rehabilitation process. Various loading interventions can be used by clinicians to produce physical stress to address body function, physical impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. By modifying the mechanical load elements, clinicians can alter the tissue adaptations, facilitate motor learning, and resolve corresponding physical impairments. Providing different loads that create variable tensile, compressive, and shear deformation on the tissue through mechanotransduction and specificity can promote the appropriate stress adaptations to increase tissue capacity and injury tolerance. Tools for monitoring rehabilitation training loads to the knee are proposed to assess the reactivity of the knee joint to mechanical loading to monitor excessive mechanical loads and facilitate optimal rehabilitation.","David S Logerstedt

Evaluation and treatment of disorders of the infrapatellar fat pad,"The infrapatellar fat pad (IFP), also known as Hoffa's fat pad, is an intracapsular, extrasynovial structure that fills the anterior knee compartment, and is richly vascularized and innervated. Its degree of innervation, the proportion of substance-P-containing fibres and close relationship to its posterior synovial lining implicates IFP pathologies as a source of infrapatellar knee pain. Though the precise function of the IFP is unknown, studies have shown that it may play a role in the biomechanics of the knee or act as a store for reparative cells after injury. Inflammation and fibrosis within the IFP, caused by trauma and/or surgery can lead to a variety of arthrofibrotic lesions including Hoffa's disease, anterior interval scarring and infrapatellar contracture syndrome. Lesions or mass-like abnormalities rarely occur within the IFP, but their classification can be narrowed down by radiographical appearance. Clinically, patients with IFP pathology present with burning or aching infrapatellar anterior knee pain that can often be reproduced on physical exam with manoeuvres designed to produce impingement. Sagittal MRI is the most common imaging technique used to assess IFP pathology including fibrosis, inflammation, oedema, and mass-like lesions. IFP pathology is often successfully managed with physical therapy. Passive taping is used to unload or shorten an inflamed IFP, and closed chain quadriceps exercises can improve lower limb control and patellar congruence. Training of the gluteus medius and stretching the anterior hip may help to decrease internal rotation of the hip and valgus force at the knee. Gait training and avoiding hyperextension can also be used for long-term management. Injections within the IFP of local anaesthetic plus corticosteroids and IFP ablation with ultrasound guided alcohol injections have been successfully explored as treatments for IFP pain. IFP pathology refractory to physical therapy can be approached through a variety of operative treatments. Arthroscopic partial resection for IFP impingement and Hoffa's disease has showed favourable results; however, total excision of the IFP performed concomitantly with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) resulted in worse results when compared with TKA alone. Arthroscopic debridement of IFP fibrosis has been successfully used to treat extension block following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and arthroscopic anterior interval release has been an effective treatment for pain associated with anterior interval scarring. Arthroscopic resection of infrapatellar plicae and denervation of the inferior pole of the patella have also been shown to be effective treatments for refractory infrapatellar pain.","Jason L Dragoo

Discoid lateral meniscus: current concepts,"The discoid meniscus is a congenital morphological abnormality encountered far more commonly on the lateral than the medial side. The discoid lateral meniscus (DLM) is more prevalent in Asia with an incidence of 10%-13%, than in the Western world with an incidence of 3%-5%. DLM can be bilateral in more than 80% cases. Due to its abnormal shape and size, the discoid meniscus is prone to tearing and has an impact on gait mechanics. The discoid meniscus has deranged collagen arrangement and vascularity which can have implications for healing after a repair. Patients with a DLM may or may not be symptomatic with mechanical complaints of locking, clicking, snapping or pain. Symptoms often arise due to a tear in the body of the meniscus or a peripheral detachment. Asymptomatic patients usually do not require any treatment, while symptomatic patients who do not have locking are managed conservatively. When a peripheral detachment is present, it must be stabilised while preserving the meniscus rim to allow transmission of hoop stresses. Rehabilitation after surgery is highly individualised and return to sports is possible after more than 4 months in those undergoing a repair. The functional outcomes and onset of radiographic arthritis after saucerisation and repairing a discoid meniscus are better in the long term, compared with a subtotal meniscectomy. However, there is no compelling evidence currently favouring a repair as results deteriorate with increasing follow-up. Poor prognosis is reported in patients undergoing a total meniscectomy, a higher age at presentation and valgus malalignment.","Sachin Tapasvi

The role of proprioception in the management and rehabilitation of athletic injuries,"Rehabilitation continues to evolve with the increased emphasis on patient management and proprioceptive training. Proprioception can be defined as a specialized variation of the sensory modality of touch that encompasses the sensation of joint movement (kinesthesia) and joint position (joint position sense). Numerous investigators have observed that afferent feedback to the brain and spinal pathways is mediated by skin, articular, and muscle mechanoreceptors. Examining the effects of ligamentous injury, surgical intervention, and proprioceptively mediated activities in the rehabilitation program provides an understanding of the complexity of this system responsible for motor control. It appears that this neuromuscular feedback mechanism becomes interrupted with injury and abnormalities, and approaches restoration after surgical intervention and rehabilitation. Rehabilitation programs should be designed to include a proprioceptive component that addresses the following three levels of motor control: spinal reflexes, cognitive programming, and brainstem activity. Such a program is highly recommended to promote dynamic joint and functional stability. Thus far, current knowledge regarding the basic science and clinical application of proprioception has led the profession of sports medicine one step closer to its ultimate goal of restoring function.","S M Lephart

Mobilization under anaesthesia for correction of knee flexion deformity in haemophilia,"Introduction:
        
      
      Haemophilia patients not treated with primary or secondary prophylaxis, often present with recurrent haemarthrosis. Knee is the most frequently involved joint leading to disabling knee flexion deformity (KFD). Here, we present a retrospective study of our experience on the role of mobilization under general anaesthesia in the correction of KFD.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To study the effectiveness of mobilization under anaesthesia (MUA) for correction of knee flexion deformity (KFD) in persons with haemophilia (PWH).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Outcome of all patients managed with MUA in our multidisciplinary haemophilia clinic from 2008 to 2019 were included for analysis. PWH with KFD > 20 degree who underwent MUA were included in the study. Under general anaesthesia and cover of clotting factor replacement, gentle joint mobilization was done to achieve maximal correction in flexion deformity, followed by above knee casting in this position. The outcome measures assessed were reduction in knee flexion deformity following MUA and complications, if any.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty patients (34 knees) with knee flexion deformity were included in the study. Mean age of the study population was 14.23 years ± 8.3. Study population was analysed in two groups, Group 1 included patients who underwent single MUA and Group 2, patients who underwent two or more MUA. There was significant improvement in KFD correction in both groups. [Group 1; Mean difference: 22 ± 13.7, p value -0.01, 95% CI (16.4-27.5) and Group 2; Mean difference 48.8 ± 19.8, p value -0.00, 95% CI (34.2-64.5)].
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      MUA can be effective in the short-term correction of KFD in PWH particularly those below 15 years of age. It should be done judiciously when target correction is not achieved with other physical methods.","Prince Thakkar

Effects of idiopathic flatfoot deformity on knee adduction moments during walking,"Introduction:
        
      
      Flatfoot deformity is commonly characterized by a subtalar valgus, a low medial longitudinal arch, and abduction of the forefoot. Although flatfoot deformity has been associated with lower first (KAM1) and second (KAM2) peak knee adduction moments during walking, the biomechanical connection remains unknown.
    


          Research question:
        
      
      We hypothesized that hindfoot eversion, lateral calcaneal shift correlate with KAM1 and forefoot abduction and arch height with KAM2, due to the lateralization of the ground reaction force vector resulting from shifted heel and forefoot in flatfoot deformity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Gait data from 103 children with flatfoot deformity who underwent three-dimensional gait analysis with the Oxford Foot Model were retrospectively included. Children with knee varus/valgus, in- and out-toeing were excluded. Fifteen healthy children with a rectus foot type were also collected from the database. Lateral calcaneal shift was defined as the distance between the projection of the ankle joint center onto the calcaneal axis and the midpoint of the calcaneal axis formed by the medial and lateral calcaneal markers. A subgroup of children with idiopathic flatfoot deformity that had received corrective surgery was also identified. Statistical analysis included Pearson's correlations and independent and paired t-tests (α < .05).
    


          Results:
        
      
      When compared to a norm cohort, flatfooted children had significant lower KAM1 and KAM2 (t-test, P < .001). Lateral calcaneal shift correlated with KAM1 and KAM2 (r = 0.42, p < .001 and r = 0.32, P < .001, respectively). Arch height correlated with KAM2 (r = 0.23, p = 0.017). KAM1 and KAM2 normalized after surgery and the change in KAM1 correlated with the change in lateral calcaneal shift for children who underwent corrective surgery.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      Lateral calcaneal shift explains the reduction of KAM1 by lateralization of the point of force application in flatfooted children. It is recommended to consider the lateral calcaneal shift when investigating KAM in gait analysis research.","S Kimberly Byrnes

Total Knee Arthroplasty in Patients with Blount Disease or Blount-Like Deformity,"Blount disease is associated with complex deformity of the proximal tibia, and some patients will develop knee osteoarthritis. Five patients (eight knees) with Blount disease or Blount-like deformity underwent total knee arthroplasty. Mean proximal tibial metaphyseal-diaphyseal angle was 20.75°. Each patient had substantial posteromedial tibial bony defects and six knees required extensive medial releases. Two knees required increased constraint at index procedure. One patient has undergone bilateral revision surgery with rotating hinge prostheses. Mean WOMAC scores were 13.5 and Knee Society scores were 212.5 at average 75.2 month follow-up. Despite technical challenges, patients with these deformities can have successful outcomes after total knee arthroplasty. Surgeons should be prepared to address posteromedial tibial bony defects and consider constrained arthroplasty at the index procedure.","Roman M Natoli

Synovial osteochondromatosis,"A 75-year-old man of Fijian-Indian extraction complained of a 3-year history of progressive right knee pain and stiffness which were limiting his mobility. On examination, multiple hard nodules were palpable in the popliteal fossa and along the path of the quadriceps tendon. The joint line was not tender, knee flexion was limited to 60 degrees and there was a fixed flexion deformity of 5 degrees. The knee ligaments were intact. Examination of other joints did not reveal nodules.

Congenital fibular deficiency,"Congenital fibular deficiency (CFD) is characterized by a wide spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild limb length inequality (LLI) to severe shortening, with foot and ankle deformities and associated anomalies. The etiology of CFD remains unclear. Treatment goals are to achieve normal weight bearing, a functional plantigrade foot, and equal limb length. The recent Birch classification system has been proposed to provide a treatment guide: the functionality of the foot, LLI, and associated anomalies should be taken into account for decision-making. Treatment options include orthosis or epiphysiodesis, Syme or Boyd amputation and prosthetic rehabilitation, limb lengthening procedures, and foot and ankle reconstruction. The outcome of amputation for severe forms of CFD has shown favorable results and fewer complications compared with those of limb lengthening. Nevertheless, advances in the limb lengthening techniques may change our approach to treating patients with CFD and might extend the indications for reconstructive procedures to the treatment of severe LLI and foot deformities.","Reggie C Hamdy, Asim M Makhdom, Neil Saran, John Birch",J Am Acad Orthop Surg,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//24668354/,2025-06-03 09:03:22,PubMed,0.07666666666666666,0.41,neutral,1,0.2511223566192896,0.16354916912687412
